This is a small electronic forms system that helps you optimize your
experience when running checkin at a BEST Robotics "Classic"
competition.  It provides the compliance forms, as well as a checklist
for teams to complete checkin.

At present it is only supported to build and run this software on a
linux machine, or in an environment where a docker compatible
container runtime is available.

The format of the CSV file that is imported at
`http://<address>/admin` is the same as that used for the PCSM import
functionality.
